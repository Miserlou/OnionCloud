OnionCloud
==========

OnionCloud - An Anonymous Heroku-like PaaS

## About OnionCloud

While developing HitStarter, we became quickly aware of how tedious it is to deploy hidden services. Currently, there
are no hosting providers which offer modern application deployment solutions like Heroku, only VPS services which
require countless hours of server deployment and maintenance. This is harming the Onionverse, as there are less free
anonymous web services because of how difficult and annoying it is to deploy them.

We'd like to develop a service, similar to Heroku, which would allow single command deployment of anonymous services:

> git remote add onioncloud123456.onion/myapp

> git push onion master

and it's live!

This would also enable the ability to rapidly develop applications on top of OnionCloud, including anonymous
communication and publishing services and single-serving marketplaces.

## Technology

This service will be built on top of dotCloud's 'Docker' container platform. It will be kept as Free and Open Source software, and
hosted applications will be provided at the lowest cost possible, with a free tier if it's possible to do so. 

We aim to support a number of different application execution environments, including support for PHP, Java,
JavaScript, Python and Ruby.

## Funding

We are seeking to raise some money in order to hire 1 additional developer to help build and deploy this service. The timeframe is 3 months
after the funding deadline to a beta, and then 3 months after that to develop a 1.0 version of the service.
